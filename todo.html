  - Create a user test
  - Once you've verified the hypothesis, throw out the mvp.
    - Get user to borrow $10: I'm going to lend you $10
    - Lend to a user: he wants $20

    I want to see if first time users can understand the flow.
    
    {Borrow: $10} I would like to borrow some money for lunch.
    {Borrow: $20} I would like to borrow some money for dinner as well.
  
    {Borrow: $10} I would like to borrow some money to buy my roommate a present.

  - Update user to show



  - Test like a mofo
