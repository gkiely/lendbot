Bot feedback?

Maybe add suggestions for ways to pay.
FAQ etc

Ability to setup a lendbot paypal
Link lendbot to paypal, once it's sent event/ or you can post the link to the transaction.


>> Jono feedback
money sent
paypal


Borrowing
=====
Needs user history


Jono's feedback was that it would be better if it was a website, with data on the user, and you could see how long it takes them to pay back.

And you could just click buttons as opposed to typing {lend: $amount}




Thoughts

Maybe people won't want to borrow with their username?
